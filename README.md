Grocery shopping website

  Our proposed system is an online grocery shopping website where on searching the dish name and option of buying the ingredients from various websites will be shown along with dish recommendation.

Getting Started
Make sure that following modules are installed
Beautifulsoup
Flask
Python 3.4 
Any python text editor 
Mysql
Reactjs
Nodemodules
Bootstrap
 
 
Database
Create a database which will contain all the dishname and ingredients ,recipes and img tags.

 
Model for recommendation
Read the  dataframe using pandas 
In order  to vectorize the data we will use count vectorizer 
As it is the content based recommendation we will be using cosine similarity
Web -scraping
Using beautiful soup , we will get the html format of the product /ingredient
Link of each and every ingredient will be present in the db from where we will get  the href link as well as the class or id of the content .
